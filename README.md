# Causal Tracing

Causal Tracing has been used in [ROME](https://rome.baulab.info/) and [MEMIT](https://memit.baulab.info/) as a technique to localize certain factual associations in LLM parameters. This repository contains only the causal tracing code, decoupled from the [ROME codebase](https://github.com/kmeng01/rome), slightly modularized, and added support for some of the newer LLMs. 

All credit goes to the original authors of the ROME paper.
